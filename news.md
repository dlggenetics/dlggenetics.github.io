### 2018, July

*Connor Pedersen's last day. After graduating this spring he stuck around to help with one last field season before heading off for his new job at Los Alamos. 

* Working with the Yang, Sigmon, and Alfano labs we dug up 1000 maize root samples for the CRRI project. By the end (almost) everyone was really happy that we're a heavily computational lab.

* [Our first paper in pearl millet](https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.118.200242), a collaboration with ICRISAT (with Zhikai as lead author) was published in G3. Also check out Daniel's really fun [animated GIF of the whole pearl millet lifecycle.](https://imgur.com/a/k2mnT3i)

### 2018, May

* A successful planting in at UNL's Havelock farm. 80,000 total kernels put into the ground over two days. Fortunate to have Schnable Lab alumni as a professor here at UNL to make this happen.

### 2018, April

* With help and guidance from Jinliang Yang, his lab, and the Alfano lab, we're preparing for our first real field season since the Schnable Lab at UNL was founded. 

![Field Preparations](/images/News_Images/FieldPrep.jpg){:width="500" align="middle" }

* Holly Podliska presents on her UCARE project over the past year, linking experimentally measured cold and freezing tolerance of grass species to botanical records of where the same species have been observed in the wild. Unfortunately we're losing her at the end of the semester when she moves on to student teaching.
