* [The new proso millet genome was published in Nature Communications](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-08409-5)! Three members of Dryland Genetics Santosh Rajput, Patrick Schnable, and James Schnable, as well as Delin Li from our sister company Data2Bio all contributed to making the dream of a proso millet genome a reality. 


* One of our founders (Patrick Schnable) [was interviewed in the High Plains journal](https://www.hpj.com/bickel/genetics-combined-with-management-and-technology-is-helping-ogallala-farmers/article_3c6f444c-610f-59cf-8d7d-17f8b4fd2158.html) about Dryland Genetics and our mission.


* We were proud to be one of the sponsors of the 3rd annual broomcorn (proso) millet conference held this summer in Ft. Collin's, CO. It was also fascinating conference, especially getting to hear from all the innovative companies working on new ways to incorporate more proso millet into food products at the same time we're working to grow more proso millet.
