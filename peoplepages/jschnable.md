James Schnable is an assistant professor of Agronomy at the University of Nebraska Lincoln, affiliated with both the Center for Plant Science Innovation and the Quantitative Life Sciences Initiative. Research in his lab focuses on employing new methods to combine phenotypic and functional genomic data in crop plants, and involves close collaborations with computer scientists, statisticians, engineers, and applied plant breeders. This work has allowed him to found three startups: Data2Bio (focused on genotyping and breeding decision support), Dryland Genetics (breeding naturally water use efficient crops), and EnGeniousAg (low cost nondestructive nutrient and water sensors for farmers), and to publish 40 peer-reviewed publications in journals including Science, Genome Biology, and Plant Cell.   His research is currently supported by the National Science Foundation, The United States Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy, the Nebraska Corn Growers Association, and private industry. Dr. Schnable earned a BA from Cornell University in 2008 and a PhD from the University of California-Berkeley in 2012.
