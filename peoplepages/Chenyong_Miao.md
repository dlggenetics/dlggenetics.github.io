Chenyong comes from Xinxiang, a city in northern Henan province, China. He received his B.S. in Biotechnology from Henan University of Science and Technology in 2013. He then moved to Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University where he worked with Schnable Lab collaborator Haibao Tang, investigating allele-specific expression in hybrid rice. During his time at FAFU, he also had the chance to work on other projects, including the assembly and annotation of the pineapple genome. He graduated with a masters degree in bioinformatics in June 2016 and joined the Schnable Lab as a PhD student in Fall 2016
